/*
 * The API described in this header is meant to allow for file system browsing in a
 * portable fashions. To this ends, multiple or single roots have to be supported
 * (compare Unix with a single root, Windows with multiple roots C:, D:, ...).
 *
 * To this end, we abstract away from paths; implementations can be based on
 * paths (and it's left to them whether / or \ or : is the path separator :-);
 * but it is also possible to use inodes or vrefs (MacOS 9) or anything else.
 *
 * You may ask now: "isn't this cheating? Why do we go through all this when we use
 * a path in the end anyway?!?".
 * Well, for once as long as we don't provide our own file open/read/write API, we
 * still have to use fopen(). Since all our targets already support fopen(), it should
 * be possible to get a fopen() compatible string for any file system node.
 *
 * Secondly, with this abstraction layer, we still avoid a lot of complications based on
 * differences in FS roots, different path separators, or even systems with no real
 * paths (MacOS 9 doesn't even have the notion of a "current directory").
 * And if we ever want to support devices with no FS in the classical sense (Palm...),
 * we can build upon this.
